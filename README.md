# Attendance-Management-System-using-Face-Recognition-and-MongoDb-Database
<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>This project is an innovative Attendance Management System that uses facial recognition technology to automate attendance tracking. It leverages Python, OpenCV, and MongoDB to provide an efficient and user-friendly interface for educational institutions and workplaces.</p>

<h2>Features..</h2>
<p> 1) Face Detection: Uses Haar Cascade to detect faces in real time.</p>
<p> 2) Attendance Logging: Automatically logs attendance with timestamps.</p>
<p> 3) Database Integration: Stores student details and attendance records in MongoDB.</p>
<p> 4) Manual Attendance: Supports manual entry for additional flexibility.</p>
<p> 5) GUI Interface: Easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter.</p>


<h2>How It Works...</h2>
 <p>1] User Input: Students' enrollment numbers, names, and subjects are entered via the GUI.</p>
 <p>2] Face Detection: The system captures multiple images of the student using a webcam.</p>
 <p>3] Data Storage: Captured data, along with attendance logs, are stored in a MongoDB database.</p>
 <p>4] Attendance Logging: Students' faces are matched with existing records to log attendance.</p>
 <p>5] Manual Attendance: Facilitates attendance entry in case of system issues.</p>

<p>
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, Tkinter, Pymongo
Database: MongoDB
