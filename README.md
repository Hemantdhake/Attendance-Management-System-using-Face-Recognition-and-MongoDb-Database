# Attendance-Management-System-using-Face-Recognition-and-MongoDb-Database
<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>This project is an innovative Attendance Management System that uses facial recognition technology to automate attendance tracking. It leverages Python, OpenCV, and MongoDB to provide an efficient and user-friendly interface for educational institutions and workplaces.</p>

<h2>Features..</h2>
 1) Face Detection: Uses Haar Cascade to detect faces in real time.
 2) Attendance Logging: Automatically logs attendance with timestamps.
 3) Database Integration: Stores student details and attendance records in MongoDB.
 4) Manual Attendance: Supports manual entry for additional flexibility.
 5) GUI Interface: Easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter.


<h1>How It Works...</h1>
  1] User Input: Students' enrollment numbers, names, and subjects are entered via the GUI.
  2] Face Detection: The system captures multiple images of the student using a webcam.
  3] Data Storage: Captured data, along with attendance logs, are stored in a MongoDB database.
  4] Attendance Logging: Students' faces are matched with existing records to log attendance.
  5] Manual Attendance: Facilitates attendance entry in case of system issues.
